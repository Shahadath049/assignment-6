                <span>Question 1: </span> What are the differences between Var, Let, and Const in Javascript?

                     JavaScript has three variable declaration statements: var, let and const. The latter two were added in ES6, whereas var existed since previous versions. One of the first things to notice is that const defines constants (i.e. values that will not be reassigned), whereas var and let define variables. Yet, var behaves differently from both let and const in various other ways. <br>
                     <span class="text-info fw-bold">Scope</span> <br>
                    Variables declared with var are function scoped, in contrast to variables declared with let or const which are block scoped. <br>
                    <span class="text-info fw-bold">Hoisting</span> <br>
                    While variables declared with var are hoisted to the enclosing scope, variables declared with let or const are not initialized until their definition is evaluated. <br>
                    <span class="text-info fw-bold">Redeclaration</span> <br>
                    In strict mode, variables declared with var can be re-declared in the same scope, whereas this is not allowed for variables declared with let or const. <br>
                    <span class="text-info fw-bold">Global object property</span> <br>
                    At the top level, variables declared with var, unlike ones declared with let or const, create a property on the global object.

                <span>Question 2: </span> What are the differences between Arrow and Regular Functions ?
            </h2>
            <div class="p-6">
                <p class="container fs-4">
                    <span class="fs-3 text-warning fw-bold">Answer :</span> <br>
                    In this post, I'll show the main differences between the two, so you could choose the right syntax for your needs.<br>
                     <span class="text-info fw-bold">this value</span> <br>
                     Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.

                     The dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In JavaScript, there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function. <br>
                     The behavior of this inside of an arrow function differs considerably from the regular function's this behavior. The arrow function doesn't define its own execution context. <br>
                    <span class="text-info fw-bold">Constructors</span> <br>
                    the regular function can easily construct objects. <br>
                    A consequence of this resolved lexically is that an arrow function cannot be used as a constructor<br>
                    <span class="text-info fw-bold">Arguments binding</span> <br>
                    rrow functions do not have an arguments binding. However, they have access to the arguments object of the closest non-arrow parent function. Named and rest parameters are heavily relied upon to capture the arguments passed to arrow functions. <br>
                    <span class="text-info fw-bold">Using new keyword</span> <br>
                    Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword.

                    However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword. <br>
                    <span class="text-info fw-bold">No duplicate named parameters</span> <br>
                    Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or non-strict mode.With arrow functions, duplicate named arguments are always, regardless of strict or non-strict mode, invalid.
